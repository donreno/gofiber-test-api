# gofiber test API
Just built a simple gofiber API by following https://docs.gofiber.io/ and https://blog.logrocket.com/express-style-api-go-fiber/ and of course with a bit of my own ideas.

## Running the app and testing

To run the app simply do `go run main.go` on a terminal

To test just use the [postman collection](product-api-test.postman_collection.json)

**Note**: still needs a lot of refactor
